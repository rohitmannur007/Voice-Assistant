# **Voice Assistant for Home Automation**

## **Project Overview**
This project is a voice-controlled assistant powered by deep learning and NLP technologies, designed to perform tasks such as setting reminders, playing music, providing real-time information, and controlling home automation systems. The assistant adapts to user interactions, becoming smarter over time. This project was developed from scratch, including data collection, model building, and deployment.

## **Features**
- **Voice Interaction**: Responds to voice commands to perform tasks.
- **Real-Time Information**: Provides weather updates, news, and other real-time data.
- **Home Automation**: Controls smart home devices with voice commands.
- **Self-learning**: Continuously improves through live interaction.
- **Custom Dataset**: Voice dataset collected for the Indian continent and other regions.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Deep Learning (NLP)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - SpeechRecognition
  - NLTK
  - SpaCy
  - Flask (for API)
- **Database**: SQL
- **Cloud**: AWS / Azure / GCP for model hosting
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## **System Architecture**
The system is composed of several modules that work together:
1. **Voice Recognition**: Converts speech to text.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Processes text input to understand and respond.
3. **Home Automation**: Integrates with smart devices.
4. **Machine Learning Model**: Learns from interactions to provide better responses.

## **Setup & Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-assistant.git
cd voice-assistant
```

### **2. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Dataset:**
You will need to collect or create your own voice dataset, particularly focused on Indian and other global accents. Ensure it’s stored and accessible in the appropriate directory.

### **4. Run the Model:**
To test the voice assistant, run the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

### **5. API Endpoints (Optional)**:
The solution exposes several API endpoints to interact with the assistant remotely. See `api_docs.md` for detailed usage.

## **Deployment**
The model can be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP. Follow these steps:
1. Set up a cloud environment.
2. Host the model using **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
3. Expose the API for voice interaction or home automation control.

---

## **Evaluation Criteria**
- **Modular Code**: The code is written in a modular fashion following PEP 8 standards.
- **Portability**: The project works across different environments (Windows/Linux/Mac).
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test cases are included.
- **Logging**: All actions are logged using the Python `logging` library.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Improved voice recognition for various accents and dialects.
- Additional home automation features (e.g., thermostat control, security systems).
- Mobile app integration for seamless user interaction.
